		 * Say your brother wants to buy a used car for $5,000 and has only $2,000 for the down payment.
		   He hits you up for a loan for the remaining $3,000.
		   If the length of the loan is five years and heâ€™s paying you simple interest of 3.5 percent per year to borrow the additional $3,000,
		   Calculate the sum of interest, monthly payment, and a total of payment.
		   
		  Output:
			Enter the yearly interest rate, for example, 3.5: 3.5
			Enter the number of years as an integer, for example, 5: 5
			Enter the loan amount, for example, 3000.00: 3000
			The monthly payment is $105.0
			The total payment is $6300.0
