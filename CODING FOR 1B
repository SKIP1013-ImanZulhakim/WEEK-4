/*
 * Calculate the total price that needs to be paid by a customer in C_MARTS.
 * How many items that the customer buys (the maximum number of items is 3).
 * The program will ask the quantity and price of each item.
 * Each time the quantity and price are entered, they must be multiplied and totaled up.
 * The program should calculate the discount obtained by the customer based on the total price.
 * If the customer buys more than RM100, he/she is entitled to a 20% discount,
 * Else the total price is less than RM100 the customer is only entitled to 10% discount.
 * The program should display the total price before discount, discount received and the amount that needs to be paid.
